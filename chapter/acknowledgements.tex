\epigraph{``Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn't do than by the ones you did do. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover."}{--- \textup{Mark Twain}}

The culmination of work presented in this thesis would not have been possible without the guidance and support of many. But my involvement in this PhD project would not have even begun if not for my supervisor who accepted me into the program and a former colleague who forwarded the opening to me. I still remember the predicament I faced over 4 years ago when I had to decide whether or not I would commit to the idea of potentially working in Japan. I had already brushed off the idea once but in the end I was convinced that it was a tremendous opportunity and I would have regretted it if I let it slip by. In the end, I decided to set my sails to explore an entirely new world.

To this day, I have absolutely no regrets for embarking on this journey; I had to leave beind close friends but I still remember their responses when I asked for their advice regarding the opportunity. Their answers were unanimous; clearly, they had had enough of me. Thankfully, I was able to make new friends in Japan; some became closer friends and some drifted away (not everyone can put up with my quirkiness). While I've been much like a hermit, on occasions, they still ask me to go out; thanks for not totally giving up on me. I also had the pleasure of meeting some very dedicated researchers whom I greatly admire, for their scientific knowledge and drinking prowess. I have tried to shape myself in their footsteps, both scientifically and in drinking ability; I hope one day I can make them proud. I would also like to acknowledge the Good Samaritans who answer questions on discussion forums and mailing lists; where would I be without them.
