\epigraph{``Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn't do than by the ones you did do. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover."}{--- \textup{Mark Twain}}

(I will update this later.)

The culmination of work presented in this thesis would not have been possible without the guidance and support of many friends and colleagues. But my involvement in this PhD project would not have even begun if not for my supervisor who accepted me into the program and a former colleague who forwarded the opening to me. I still remember the predicament I faced over 4 years ago when I had to decide whether or not I would commit to the idea of potentially working in Japan. I had already brushed off the idea once but in the end I was convinced that it was a tremendous opportunity and I would have regretted it if I let it slip by. In the end, I decided to set my sails to explore an entirely new world.

To this day, I have absolutely no regrets for embarking on this journey and it has been the best experience of my life (thus far). I had to leave behind close friends of many years but I still remember their responses when I asked for their advice regarding the opportunity in Japan. Their answers were unanimous; clearly, they had had enough of me. I've made many new friends in Japan and I'd like to think that they know who they are. Thanks guys and gals for enduring me! I would also like to acknowledge the Good Samaritans who answer questions on discussion forums and mailing lists; where would I be without them.
