\epigraph{``Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn't do than by the ones you did do. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover."}{--- \textup{Mark Twain}}

The culmination of work presented in this thesis would not have been possible without the guidance and support of many. But my involvement in this PhD project would not have even begun if not for my supervisor who accepted me into the program and a former colleague who forwarded the opening to me. I still remember the predicament I faced over 4 years ago when I had to decide whether or not I would commit to the idea of potentially working in Japan. I had already brushed off the idea once but in the end I was convinced that it was a tremendous opportunity and I would have regretted it if I let it slip by. In the end, I decided to set my sails to explore an entirely new world.

To this day, I have absolutely no regrets for embarking on this journey; I had to leave behind close friends of many years but I still remember their responses when I asked for their advice regarding the opportunity. Their answers were unanimous; clearly, they had had enough of me. I arrived in Japan knowing just one single person, who I got to know through a Perl mailing list. Though we were complete strangers, he helped me settle into Japan and I'm forever thankful. At work, I met a lot of awesome people. The first order of business was to find out where I could play basketball and I was introduced to my basketball buddy for the last 3 years. Thank you for preventing me from suffering from basketball withdrawal! There are two colleagues who despite my hermit tendencies still occasionally ask me to hang out. Thank you for not giving up on me, yet. I also had the pleasure of meeting some highly dedicated researchers whom I greatly admire, for their scientific knowledge and personality. I have learned a lot from you all and I have tried to shape myself in your footsteps. I would also like to acknowledge the Good Samaritans who answer questions on discussion forums and mailing lists; where would I be without them.

Finally, thank \textit{you} from the bottom of my heart.
