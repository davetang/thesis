Small non-coding RNAs have been implicated in many biological processes, such as messenger RNA regulation or transposon silencing. We identified a role of small non-coding RNAs in the DNA damage repair mechanism. The inactivation of dicer and drosha, which are required for the biogenesis of small RNAs, leads to a loss of DNA damage repair. We sequenced the small RNAs from cells that had induced DNA damage and found small RNAs arising from the vicinity of the DNA double-strand break. Importantly, synthetic small RNAs mimicking these small RNAs could drive the DNA damage response \cite{francia2012site}.

Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD) is a slowly progressive disease in which dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra degenerate undetected for years before clinical symptoms develop. The lack of clinical symptoms highlights the necessity of a laboratory test, such as an assay for biomarkers, which can correlate subjects with PD risk. We have profiled the RNAs in the whole blood sample of PD patients and age-matched controls using high-throughput deepCAGE sequencing. By comparing the RNA profiles between PD patients and controls, we aim to discover novel biomarkers that are present in whole blood, which may be further developed into a non-invasive clinical test for PD.

\begin{itemize}
   \item Are the majority of detected low-level transcription due to technical artifacts and/or background biological noise?
   \item Sequencing depth and sampling of RNA molecules; absolute transcript quantification will help (such as using unique molecule identifiers and non-PCR based methods)
   \item Functional transcriptomics in the post-ENCODE era, specifically what is the criteria for functionality
   \item The technologies that allowed full length cDNA sequencing
   \item PacBio sequencing has read lengths greater than 10kb and can be used for full length cDNA sequencing
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Experimental differences}

Starting RNA amount required by different protocols and it may not be possible obtain sufficient amounts of starting material. Thus PCR-based techniques are popular and are able to amplify RNA isolated from single cells. This leads to less heterogeneity compared to techniques that pool cells, which may have very different expression profiles. It is important to obtain a true profile of transcription in cells.

DNA sequences do not exist as naked DNA \textit{in vivo}, but are usually packaged in higher order DNA structures thus \textit{in vitro} models may not recapitulate the entire story.

\subsection{Signal versus noise}

The primary aim of transcriptomics is to capture the expression patterns of the full set of transcripts in a cell or tissue. However, technical and biological variances cause fluctuations in the measurements, which is referred to as noise. Technical variation may result from the sequencing technology and from carrying out the experimental protocol; this type of noise is predictable and follows a Poisson distribution. Biological variation arises from the natural variability in different biological entities; this variation can be small for genetically identical samples or can be very large, such as in a heterogeneous sample such as blood. Biological variation may be due to biological processes that are not perfect such as noisy splicing, which increases the mRNA isoform diversity in human cells\cite{pmid21151575}. Other sources of noise may be from contamination, such as from genomic DNA.
